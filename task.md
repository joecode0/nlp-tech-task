### Machine Learning Data Scientist - Technical Assessment 
## Overview :mag: 

This repository contains raw data extracted from open source databases. Your task is to develop a data preparation pipeline suitable for training a machine learning model.

This task will focus on:

    - Data ingestion and cleaning (handling inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates)
    - Data enrichment (e.g., feature/signal engineering, base category creation)
    - Data structuring (transforming text-based fields into structured formats for ML models)
    - Dataset visualization (exploratory analysis of distributions, text characteristics, etc.)
    - (Optional): You may train a basic ML algorithm using this data to prove efficacy of the above. *Though we must stress this is not in any way going to affect the outcome of the test*

Your submission should be a .zip file containing all necessary code to run your project, along with instructions (e.g., command-line arguments, installation steps).

We recommend not spending more than 4 hours on this assignment.

## Task Scope :book:
1️⃣ Data Ingestion & Cleaning

    Load data.
    Handle inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect field types, duplicate entries).
    Deal with missing values in a structured way.
    Ensure fields are properly formatted.

2️⃣ Data Enrichment

    Text Preprocessing: Normalise, clean, and tokenize text data for modelling.
    Feature Engineering: Generate useful features (e.g., text length, keyword extraction).

3️⃣ Data Structuring

    Convert raw descriptions into structured formats suitable for ML models.
    Decide how best to represent text (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings).
    Design a structured dataset ready for model training.

4️⃣ Data Visualization

    Use visuals (e.g., bar charts, word clouds) to analyze patterns in descriptions.
    Identify potential data biases or issues.

## What We Are Evaluating

    Handling Real-World Data: How do you process messy, unstructured data?
    Best Practices in Data Processing: Do you structure your code in a scalable, reproducible way?
    Exploratory Data Analysis: Do you provide meaningful insights before modeling?

## Submission Guidelines

    Submit a .zip file containing all required scripts.
    Include a README.md with instructions on running your pipeline.
    Email your submission to ml@filament.ai <- This is also where you can reach us if needed :smile: 

## Recommended Libraries:

    pandas / numpy for data manipulation
    matplotlib / seaborn for visualization
    scikit-learn / spaCy / NLTK for text processing
